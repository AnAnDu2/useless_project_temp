### Project Description
Our project aims to develop an application that accelerates mobile shutdown by quickly depleting battery power.
This is achieved through power-intensive tasks such as cryptographic mining, maximizing screen brightness, enabling the flash, and performing continuous calculations.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
At its core, this project tackles the admittedly unconventional problem of forcibly shutting down a mobile device by draining its battery as quickly as possible.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We are increasing the time of switching off our phone which can be done instantly by power off but we are doing it by completely wasting our time and effort.
