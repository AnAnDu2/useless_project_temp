### Project Description
PowerDown Pro Max is an app dedicated to the art of overcomplicating phone shutdowns by draining the battery with intense tasks like cryptomining, max brightness, and flash activation. 
It‚Äôs the ultimate, needlessly elaborate way to turn off your phone ‚Äî because why settle for a button when you can have an adventure?
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
"We're tackling the urgent issue of making the simplest tasks absurdly difficult!
Why settle for a button when you can run a battery-depleting marathon?
In a world where convenience rules, we‚Äôre taking a stand for inefficiency!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Our solution maximizes inconvenience by transforming a simple shutdown into a dramatic battery-draining experience. 
Instead of a quick button press, users get to watch their phone struggle as power-intensive tasks slowly sap the battery, building patience along the way.
This approach even discourages overuse‚Äîafter going through the shutdown ordeal once, users might think twice before powering it back on.
Plus, it‚Äôs perfect for pranks, letting you show friends how quickly their "long-lasting" battery can vanish.
In short, we‚Äôve turned the shutdown process into an unforgettable adventure!

App in its Default state


![Fast](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc46ec60-7a24-4f55-8424-f85ad843965b)

In this state, all background processes run, flash is on, brightness is max, and cryptomining drains the battery quickly for faster shutdown.


![Slow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad872ace-05e7-43e5-aaac-d82435cca4cd)

This state runs only CPU processes, causing slower battery drain and delayed shutdown.
